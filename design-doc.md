Block
- Prevent characters or spells from moving through squares
- Lasts through the next turn

Strike
- Downs characters

Root
- Character can't move during the next turn

Stun
- Character can't act during the next turn

Resurrect
- Returns a downed character to normal

Move
- Moves the character to another square
- Can't move through blocks
- Moving cropped at screen edges and by blocks

Shield
- Character gets a buff that cancels the next strike
- Lasts through the next turn

Push & Pull & Throw
- Moves another character

Song
- Character’s next used movement ability has +1 range

# Skill combinations?

- Increased attack range if rooted
- A strike that can destroy blocks
- A strike that can explode blocks, striking everything around them

# Classes

Pre-built classes to choose from, each with 3–5 skills made from the skill types above.

# Visual helpers

- Movement skill possibilities are shown as overlays when highlighting characters.
- Teams are distinguished with blue and red colors.
- 1,2,3,4 for selecting characters
- QWER for selecting skills

# Progression

- Lock certain classes until x plays or wins? Requires accounts.
- Communal progression: x global wins unlocks something for everyone? Felt shitty in other games.
- “Progression” through trying out different class combinations?

# How to play with strangers

- Queue system? Does it require accounts?
- Create a public game and advertise it? Urgh.
- Class selection can happen during queuing.

# Playing vs. spectating

- One URL for spectating
- Separate secret URLs for the two players

# Money

Package for iOS+Android with Meteor and for OSX+Windows with Electron? Submit to app stores and Steam? Keep free web version?

Lock certain classes until a one-time Stripe payment? Requires accounts, so ugh.
